## General Information

This project is the culmination of months of hard work growing our skills within the Galvanize course. We came together as a team to rework an existing project from a previous cohort in order to meet the demands of a client.

- Project Manager: Tailon Dow
- UI Manager: Jacob Phillips and Israr Ali
- Architecture Manager: Alex Peterec, Kendall Boone, and Weson Hilgenfeld

Working together as an Agile group, we worked hard to redesign this application visually and functionally per our client's needs. We've reworked the authentication system that correctly stores hashed passwords in the database and keeps the user logged in, reworked the whole UI to fit the clients needs, and cleaned up the entire database for seamless expereince.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, express.js, node.js,
- React, react-router, react-auth,
- jest, Vitest, Playwright,
- Docker, PostgreSQL, Git, NPM,
- Visual Studio Code, Github Projects,
- Discord, Slack, Zoom

## Features

- Login Authentication with hashed passwords stored in the database
- Central hub to view and manage all students and cohorts/classes
- Incorporate dynamic charts to measure metrics
- Ability to update and manage individualized assessment data
